* My configuration on Karabiner Elements to tweak my macOS

** Principles
  - keep on the home row
  - leverage touch typing technique
  - be emacs friendly
  - I might be switching to =evil-mode= in Emacs. Maybe, make macos
    have vim keybindings?

** Attempted tweaks:
  - [X] Launch Emacs with Command Key and "j"
  - [X] Launch Brave browser after pressing Command Key and letter "k"
  - [X] Launch Chrome with Command Key and "l"
  - [X] Launch Terminal with Command Key and "รง"
  - [X] Launch Slack with Command Key and "u"
  - [X] Launch Messages with Command Key and "i"
  - [X] Restore macOS System Preferences on keyboard modifiers and
    transport all previous tweaks (on Control, Caps Lock, Option,
    Command, and FN to Karabiner). Use karabiner
  - [X] Make the macbook Air keyboard be more like my previous UX of
    running Linux-kernel based OS on a windows keyboard
    - [X] Make caps lock key on hardware behave like control
    - [X] Make FN key on hardware behave like caps lock
    - [X] Make control key on hardware behave like FN
    - [X] Make option key on hardware behave like command
    - [X] Make command key on hardware behave like option
  - [X] Add emacs keybindings to have Emacs everywhere
  - [X] Fix copy, paste, and cut. Make it be Emacs like as =M-w=,
    =C-y=, and =C-w=.
  - [X] Make Close Tab be like Emacs =C-x k=. Be careful with =C-w=
    since it is being used for Cut!
  - [X] Make select all be Emacs like: =C-x h=. =Control+a= (windows
    tweak) will cause problems with =Control+a= from Emacs (beginning
    of line).
  - [ ] Make search be Emacs like (Control-S instead of Command f). It
    is not just tweaking the config for windows to be like Emacs.
    There is also control-g stuff on search (going backwards) and the
    importance of control g as escape in Emacs. We want C-s and no
    problem with C-g
  - [ ] Make undo be Emacs like.

** Observations:

I was using too much my left to press the left-command (which is
binded to my left-option key). This started to hurt. Hence, I am now
using the escape as left-command. This is specially relevant for app
switching via shortcuts.
